		<p>
			Don't worry, this is usually because the file is zipped up.<br>
			If the folder name has ".zip" at the end of it, right click it, and click the extract option.<br>
		</p>
		
		<h1 id= "angleshooting">I can't target any of the angles!</h1>
		<p>
			To target an angle, look at your hotbar (the rectangles at the bottom of the screen). In the first slot, you'll see a name of an angle, or a measurement.<br>
			If you think the measurement/name matches the angle in the first slot, target the angle by pressing 1.<br>
			If the angle matches a name/measurement in the second slot, target it by pressing 2.<br><br>
			If this is too much reading, just target using 1 and 2. You'll figure it out as you go.

		<h1 id= "yellowdots">What are those yellow dots?</h1>
		<p>
			Sometimes, when an asteroid disappears a yellow dot shows up. Every time you target a projectile you use up some of your projectiles. These yellow dots refuel your projectiles.<br>
			Be careful though! These yellow dots don't show up everywhere, and sometimes, they can be really hard to get!<br>
			If you don't know how much of a projectile you have left, look in your hotbar. There you can see how much of something you have left.<br>

		<h1 id= "ranking">Sometimes I see a "rank" thingy. What is it?</h1>
		<p>
			When you loose all of your health (shown by the bar on the left) you get a score card. This gives you a score based on how many asteroids you destroyed, and how long you survived.<br>
			The rank is based on your score. Good players can get to rank C, or even rank B. The best players get to rank A! Do you think you can do it?<br>
		</p>

		<h1 id= "health">What's that bar in the corner?</h1>
		
		<p>
			In the upper left corner, you'll see a health bar. Every time an asteroid hits you it goes down a little. When it gets to 0 bars, you stop playing, and a score card tells you how well you did.<br>
			If you're good at the game, you'll rarely get hit. You get points for staying alive, and the longer you're alive the more asteroids you can hit for even more points!<br>
