This game was designed in a week as a supplement to a children's book project I was supposed to submit as an assignment.
The game was a completely original idea that I decided to submit alongside it, the goal being to teach children how to identify angles quickly.
This was done through the game design by having the children control a rocket that shoots multiple projectiles, with each one only destroying a specific angle.
